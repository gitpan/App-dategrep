App::dategrep

dategrep searches the named input files for lines matching a date range
and prints them to stdout.

If dategrep works on a seekable file, it can do a binary search to find
the first and last line to print pretty efficiently. dategrep can also
read from stdin and compressed files, but it has to parse every single
line until the end of the range for those.

INSTALLATION

It is possible to install this script via perl normal install routines. 

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

Or you can build a standalone script, copy it somewhere in your path
and install its only dependency Date::Manip. In Debian you just need
the following:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build standalone
  cp dategrep-standalone ~/bin/dategrep
  apt-get install libdate-manip-perl
